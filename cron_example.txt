To schedule this to run automatically at a certain time on your system with cron (Mac/Linux have this built in), here's how to set it up:

I like to use the nano editor, so I use the following command:

EDITOR=nano crontab -e

And then, I add the following:

00 08 * * * cd /Users/me/project && python3 /Users/me/project/notify.py command arg

This goes minutes, then hours, so it runs at 8 each morning...it changes directory to the project and then executes the script.
