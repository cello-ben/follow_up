# follow_up
A simple Python program to help you keep track of people with whom you need to follow up. Cron example for the notifier attached.

Call follow_up.py when you want to add someone to the database. Just enter their name, and then enter the number of days from now that you want to be reminded.
If you have notify.py running with cron, it can notify you each day automatically when there's someone with whom you want to follow up.
There are probably a hundred ways this can be made better, but it does the trick for my purposes, and it was a fun project!
